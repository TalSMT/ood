# General explanation of the project:
## Wifi Map
We write a program that receives a csv file from a WIGLE-WIFI application with various network metrics (such as date, mac coordinates, network name, frequency, signal strength) and writes a csv file organized in the data to display up to ten networks with the strongest power. Then read this file, filter it and write a kml file with a network with the strongest power and longitude coordinates, width, and height of that grid when the goal is to show the points with their strongest position on a map when using the Google Earth system.

## Gui
The project continues by being asked to write two algorithms that will use the generated data structure and find the location of one of the MAC addresses and the location of the sample. Later on, we connected to the Sql table to update our data structure according to the table. That 's all we showed up with GUI By using the WindowsBilder, So the user can insert a folder path or a file imported from an app Wigle Wifi And receive a unified file of all data. The user can filter the data, delete them. It can run both algorithms on finding a MAC address and finding a location, and it can also ask to update the data structure by a Sql table.
