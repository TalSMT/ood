Project in object oriented course
authors: Tal SimanTov And Shaked Shiran
General explanation of the project:
We write a program that receives a csv file from a WIGLE-WIFI application with various network metrics (such as date, mac coordinates, network name, frequency, signal strength) and writes a csv file organized in the data to display up to ten networks with the strongest power. Then read this file, filter it and write a kml file with a network with the strongest power and longitude coordinates, width, and height of that grid when the goal is to show the points with their strongest position on a map when using the Google Earth system.
